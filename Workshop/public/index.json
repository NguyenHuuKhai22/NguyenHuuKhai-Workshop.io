	"content": "Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed to help users store and retrieve data in a flexible, secure, and virtually unlimitedly scalable manner. In S3, data is stored as \u0026ldquo;objects\u0026rdquo; within \u0026ldquo;buckets\u0026rdquo;. Each bucket serves as a storage container where you can upload files such as images, videos, documents, or any other type of data. Every object consists of the data itself, metadata, and a unique identifier key.\nBy using Amazon S3, you gain access to the following key features:\nUnlimited storage: Capable of storing millions of objects up to petabytes in size. High durability and availability: Data is stored with 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability and is replicated across multiple Availability Zones. Easy access via API: Supports access through RESTful API, SDKs, or AWS CLI. Strong security: Offers robust encryption and access control through IAM. Quick and easy server access: Simplified access to stored data with minimal setup. Seamless integration with other AWS services: For example, CloudFront (CDN), Lambda (serverless processing), or S3 Event Notifications. Thanks to these outstanding advantages, Amazon S3 is an ideal choice for storing images, videos, logs, backups, and various types of data in modern web systems and applications.\n"

	"content": "Project AWS: Upload Files Amazon S3 Bucket by PHP Laravel Overall In this lab, we will learn how to upload a file to an Amazon S3 Bucket using Laravel. This is a common task in modern web applications, enabling flexible, secure, and scalable cloud-based data storage.\nLaravel is a powerful and user-friendly PHP framework that provides built-in tools to simplify working with Amazon S3 through its Filesystem system and the Flysystem library. In this lesson, you will learn how to configure the connection to S3, logically process files for cloud storage, and apply security measures to ensure data safety.\nAdditionally, we will explore how to deploy the system for scalability, such as using an Auto Scaling Group to enhance responsiveness under high traffic, and a Load Balancer to distribute traffic across application servers.\nMake sure you have a solid understanding of Laravel, AWS, and how to work with remote file systems before proceeding with deployment.\nContent Introduction Preparation Add Accect key, Secret key, Region to Environment Variables Create Project Test Cleaning Up "
