# Project AWS: Upload Files Amazon S3 Bucket by PHP Laravel

### Overall
In this lab, we will learn how to upload a file to an **Amazon S3 Bucket** using **Laravel**. This is a common task in modern web applications, enabling flexible, secure, and scalable cloud-based data storage.

**Laravel** is a powerful and user-friendly PHP framework that provides built-in tools to simplify working with **Amazon S3** through its **Filesystem** system and the **Flysystem** library. In this lesson, you will learn how to configure the connection to **S3**, logically process files for cloud storage, and apply security measures to ensure data safety.

Additionally, we will explore how to deploy the system for scalability, such as using an **Auto Scaling Group** to enhance responsiveness under high traffic, and a **Load Balancer** to distribute traffic across application servers.

Make sure you have a solid understanding of **Laravel**, **AWS**, and how to work with remote file systems before proceeding with deployment.
